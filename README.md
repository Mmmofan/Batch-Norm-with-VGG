# Batch-Norm-with-VGG

This is VGG-16 net implementation with Batch-Normalization (you can see how good it is)
Easy and Simple codes hope benefit some guys tring to learn Deep Learning and take it as a new conquer

### Datasets
This codes use MNIST datasets for testing, so just download datasets online (there's many tutorials and links on-line).
If you want to use COCO or PASCAL, you need to rewrite VGG_MNIST.py to make it fit the net, also the final layer in VGG.py should be changed (like 20 if use COCO).

### Run
Download the codes and datasets save in '../MNIST/', then run VGG_MNIST.py, it start training, and weights files store in model/ which can be used lately

Alright, have fun
